# Frontend Environment Variables

Copy this file to `.env` and fill in your values:

```bash
# Polygon Mumbai Testnet Contract Address
# Deploy the contract first, then update this value
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...

# Backend API URL (default: http://localhost:3001/api)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api

# Optional: IPFS Gateway URL (for displaying IPFS content)
